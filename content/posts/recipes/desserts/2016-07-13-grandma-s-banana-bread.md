This banana bread is more of a cake due to the flour to banana ratio. 

### Steps

1. Preheat - put oven rack in middle and preheat oven to 350 °F. Grease your pan and powder with four, or use wax paper.
2. Curdle Milk - squeeze 1 Tbs lemon juice into 2/3 cup milk and let it sit until the milk curdles. About 1 minute.
3. Mix Dry Ingredients - in a large bowl, mix: 2 ½ cup sifted cake flour, ½ tbs baking soda, ½ tbs baking powder and ¾ salt.
4. Beat Together - In your blender beat: 1/2 cup butter and 2/3 cup sugar. Once they are smooth, add in 2 eggs, 1 at a time. Finally, add in the curdled milk.
5. Mix In - Add to your blender: 3 bananas, slowly fold in your Dry Ingredients. Pour the ingredients into your prepared pan.
6. Bake - Bake until a toothpick comes away clean. Let sit ~15 minutes before trying to remove from the pan.

### Notes

I sprinkle nuts on the top of the loaf after I've poured the batter instead of 
mixing them randomly into the batter. This keeps the texture of each bite 
contsistet. I also toast the nuts before I add them for extra flavor.
