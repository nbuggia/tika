title: NYTimes No Kneed Bread
ingredients: 3 cups bread flour; 1 packet (1/4 ounce) instant yeast; 1 1/2 teaspoons salt; Oil as needed
---

Combine flour, yeast and salt in a large bowl. Add 1 1/2 cups water and stir 
until blended; dough will be shaggy. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let dough 
rest about 4 hours at warm room temperature, about 70 degrees.

Lightly oil a work surface and place dough on it; fold it over on itself once or
 twice. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest 30 minutes more.

At least a half-hour before dough is ready, heat oven to 450 degrees. Put a 
6-to-8-quart heavy covered pot (cast iron, enamel, Pyrex or ceramic) in oven as 
it heats. When dough is ready, carefully remove pot from oven. Slide your hand 
under dough and put it into pot, seam side up. Shake pan once or twice if dough 
is unevenly distributed; it will straighten out as it bakes.

Cover with lid and bake 30 minutes, then remove lid and bake another 15 to 30 
minutes, until loaf is beautifully browned. Cool on a rack.
