Recipe came from my Mom. We used to eat these growing up. She would make a batch 
on the weekend and store the batter in the refrigerator. Then, each morning, we
would get fresh muffins baked. Cook time is 30 min when putting the batter in a 
cold oven and heating it up to 400 degrees.

### Steps  

1. Place above in separate bowl and add ½ cup of boiling water. Let sit while 
you combine the rest of the ingredients.
2. Add sugar and oil to mixer and mix well, frothing.
3. Add eggs, one at a time.
4. Sift dry ingredients and add alternately with buttermilk. 
5. Add the cereals, mixing well. End with a stir by hand.
6. Refrigerate and bake off as needed.
7. Bake at 400 for 20-30 minutes
