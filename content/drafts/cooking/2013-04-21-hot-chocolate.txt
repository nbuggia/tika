title: "Hot Chocolate"
---

I think there are tons of different ways to make hot chocolate, and it can't be
that hard to make chocolate and warm milk taste good. Here's a couple different
approaches.

## Cayenne & Anise

Use cayenne powder sparingly and remeber that the heat effect is cumulative. But
the kick is pertty awesome. 1 anise start should be sufficient for 6 mugs or so.

## Cinnamon & Almond Milk

I used about 20% almond milk and make sure that you check the taste to make sure
that the cinnamon isn't making the whole drink too bitter. You can counter this 
with a bit of sugar.
