This recipe comes from my mother, with a few small changes of my own. I'm quite particular about nuts in my baking. I really dislike the tast and texture of raw nuts randomly appearing in my bites, so I always make sure that I pre-roast the nuts. Even then, I still find it better to keep the nuts on top of the bread so the texture of each bite is more predictable and consistent.

## Ingredients

* 2/3 cup whole milk
* 1 Tbs fresh lemon juice
* 2 1/2 cup sifted cake flour
* 1 tbs baking powder
* 3/4 salt
* 1/2 tbs baking soda
* 1/2 cup butter
* 2/3 cup sugar
* 2 large eggs
* 3 ripe bananas

## Steps

1. **Preheat** - put oven rack in middle and preheat oven to 350 &#176;F. Grease your pan and powder with four, or use wax paper.

2. **Curdle Milk** - squeeze 1 Tbs lemon juice into 2/3 cup milk and let it sit until the milk curdles. About 1 minute.

3. **Mix Dry Ingredients** - in a large bowl, mix: 2 1/2 cup sifted cake flour, 1/2 tbs baking soda, 1/2 tbs baking powder and 3/4 salt. 

4. **Beat Together** - In your blender beat: 1/2 cup butter and 2/3 cup sugar. Once they are smooth, add in 2 eggs, 1 at a time.

5. **Mix In** - Add to your blender: 3 bananas, slowly fold in your Dry Ingredients. Pour the ingredients into your prepared pan.

6. **Bake** - Bake until a toothpick comes away clean. Let sit ~15 minutes before trying to remove from the pan.
