title: Pie Crust
---

One of the secrets to a flaky pie crust is to work with very cold butter. Cut the butter into cubes and freeze, at least 15 minutes, best over an hour or even overnight. The minute I even think I might want to make a pie, the first thing I do is cut some butter into cubes and put it in the freezer.

* 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for rolling
* 1 cup (2 sticks or 8 ounces) unsalted butter, very-cold, cut into 1/2 inch cubes
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 6 to 8 Tbsp ice water (or ice code vodka)

Instructions:

1. Cut 2 cups (2 sticks) butter into cubes and store in freezer for a few minutes

2. Combine - 2 1/2 cups Flour, 1 teaspoon Salt and 1 teaspoon Sugar in the stand mixer. Use a whisk to blend.

3. Add frozen butter cubes to stand mixer and beat on 4 speed (moderately fast) with the metal padel until the mixture looks like tiny peas.

4. Add teaspoons of ice cold water until it feels like you could roll out the balls without them cracking. (6-8)

5. Form the mixture into 2 balls, one for the pie crust and one for the pie shell

6. Roll them out on a well floured surface with a well floured rolling pin!
