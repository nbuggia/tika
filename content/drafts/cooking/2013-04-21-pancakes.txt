title: Alison's Pancakes
---

These pancakes are fluffy and delicious. I wish I had taken a picture, next 
time!

Ingredients:

* 1 1/3 cup flour
* 2/3 cup cornmeal (or 1/3 cup masa harina)
* 2 Tbs sugar
* 4 teaspoons baking powder
* 1 Tbs salt
* 2 eggs
* 1 1/3 cups milk
* 1/4 cup olive oil (or butter)

Spice it up!

* Bananas
* Walnuts, cashews
* Berries

Only use maple syrup, and only buy real New England syrup, preferably from 
Maine. (I'm not just saying this because I'm from New England BTW)
