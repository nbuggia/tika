This is a moist and delicious apple sauce cake, perfect for the Fall. It is easy to make, including baking time, it will probably take you about 2 hours (or if you are as disorganized as myself, than 3). The original recipe came from the Food Network, but I like to tell people that it is an old family recipe.

## Ingredients

Cake

* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, room temperature
* 2 cups brown sugar
* 2 eggs
* 1 teaspoon vanilla
* 2 1/4 cups flour
* 2 teaspoons baking soda
* 3/4 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon
* 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg
* 2 cups applesauce
* 1/2 cup raisins
* 1 cup chopped walnuts
* 1/2 cup confectioners sugar

Frosting

* 4 oz cream cheese, softened
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
* 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
* 1 cup confectioners sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350
2. **Wet Ingredients** – Mix these in a blender with the paddle attachment.
	* Cream the ½ cup of butter
	* Add 2 cups brown sugar
	* Add 2 eggs, one at a time

3. **Dry Ingredients** – Mix these in a separate bowl, passing them through a flour sifter

	* Add 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg
	* Use a whisk to mix up the dry ingredients
4. Add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture alternating with the 2 cups of applesauce.
5. Add in 1-1.5 cups of raisins, depending on how much you love them. Soak them in rum first, if you’re feeling spunky.
6. Grease your bunt cake pan with butter (or Crisco) and dust with flour.
7. Pour mixture into bunt cake pan – note that it will rise about 20-30%, so leave some space
8. Bake until a toothpick comes out clean. About 40 minutes – 1 hour.

	* Add 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
10. Using the spatula, paint on your frosting
11. Walnuts – you can also toast some of these in a frying pan, chop them up and sprinkle them over the frosting. Only if you like nuts.
