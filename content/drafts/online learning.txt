# Nates Take on Online Learning


I really like having video lectures. I can change the speed of the film to match the density of information in the presentation. When the prof is talking about his weekend, I'm on 2x. When he lays out the proof for a therom, I stop the film, redo it myself and then run a couple examples to make sure I understand it.

I also watch it like Netflix - all the lectures back to back and do the assignments. I feel like I have a lot less ramp up time.

The online assigments took some getting used to. There is a lot of finikiness to the expected answer format and submission, but I like how you can keep trying until you understand the correct answer for 100% of the questions. As opposed to proper quizes, where you take your score and don't worry about the rest. I almost think the grade should be a measure of how long it took you to get to 100%, instead of the score you got on the first approach.

I also really miss the personal connection with the professor and the other students. But I'm not sure this is worth the $50,000 / year gap between the free video and a full college experience. 

Some profs suck ass, we need a way to rate them. Some make things way more complicated than they should. There are also many online resources that are alternatives these days.
