## How people interact with each other

 * Are employees competing amongst each other?
 * Do you succeed or fail as one?
 * How are people goaled?
 * Are people encouraged to take risks? E.g. can they still have a good outcome if they fail?
 * 
 
It is easy to say that some of these things are wrong, but I would suggest that it is more about finding the right culture for what you're doing. 

## The "HOW" in how you do things
