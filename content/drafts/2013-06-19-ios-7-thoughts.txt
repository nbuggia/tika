title: Dear Don - You're Doing it Wrong
---

Dear Don,

I'm sensing some frustration from your announcement. Let me help you out -- your customer are not stupid, and they are not simplying hating on the XBox. Actually, everyone I know LOVES their XBox, and thinks it's among the best prodcuts from all of microsoft.

You seem frustrated because you're moves are the future, and a lot of other people are doing them. And people aren't mad at them, but they hate you. So what's the problem?

You announced all the sticks, but none of the carrots. Competent management wouldn't have talked about the sticks, they would have focused 100% on the new benefits. I know what you're going to say - oh, the ecosystem is so hard adn complicated. Okay, then you're not ready to launch,. Or you haven't done enough legg work. It is as simple as that.

Complain all you want, but this is why you should be fired, and why senior management is letting us down at microsoft.

So, stop being such a fucking victim and stop pissing on your employees who have worked long and hard.
