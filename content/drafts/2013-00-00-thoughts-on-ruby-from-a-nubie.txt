title: Thoughts on Ruby from a Nubie
---

One of my primary sabbatical goals was to ramp up on some of the big non-Microsoft technologies in web development. I evalued a handfull of options (Node.js, Python, etc) but ended up settling on Ruby because of the maturity of the technology and depth of community. 
 
With Ruby, you are not just learning a new language, you're also learning a set of frameworks, and development practices. These all come together as the basis for the web development culture. (My Microsoft friends might say the _non-microsoft_ web development culture.)

## Inturpretted Languages

execute code on the fly, easy to build plugins, dangerous for production (but everything is dangerous). Roots in PHP, Perl.

## Domain Specific Languages

## Frameworks a-Plenty


## Charting Your Own Learning Plan

1. First spend some time with Ruby the language
	- interactive ruby course
	- ruby koens challenge http://koans.heroku.com/
	- Books?

2. Git, Git

2. Do a simple project in a simple framework (Rack or Sinatra)
	- Write your own blog engine
		- baron, toto, that other one

4. Heroku, heroku
	
		
3. Play with Rails

	- railscasts
