title: leap of faith

flighting - don't ever take a blind leap of faith, you're better than that

I've been hurt before so I'm sensitive.

here's what you do

team has to believe in the idea

quick turns and focus groups need to come back positive

you need to pre-flight the parts that you can to better estimate what's going to happen

test what you can

company has to be using it internally, and they need to beleive

THEN Flight! And SHIP!
	- know why its better, tell the story, market the shit out of it!!!!

See if your metrics converge over time

3 months or 6 months flight your old experience again and see what happens.
