Mom's favorite recipe, she likes to add scallops and broccoli (cooked ahead of 
time). It has a light and fluffy taste because there is no cheese. Double the 
recipe if making it in a standard pie plate.

1. Roll out dough and fit to pie plate
2. Set rack in lowest position in oven and preheat to 375 degrees
3. Mix eggs in mixing bowl. When done, add cream and milk, and spices. Mix a bit
more
4. Pour filling into pie plate. Add additional pre-cooked ingredients as well, 
such as scallops, broccoli, etc. 
5. Bake for 40 minutes. You will know it is done when a cake tester (or knife) 
come out cleanly from the senter. 
6. Cool for 20 minutes before serving.

Pro-tips: serve with a salad as a lunch/ brunch/ dinner meal. Serve with fruit 
salad for a breakfast/ brunch meal. Alternate fillings include cheese (Gruyere, 
Emmenthal, swiss, cheddar).
