I made a single batch, yielded about a dozen pancakes, probably should have done 
a double so there was enough to freeze

They look satisfyingly thick and fluffy. The almond flour contains a lot more 
protein and gives these more substance than other pancake recipes I've tried.

Added extra milk by accident (1/2 cup total vs 1/4 normal) they seemed fluffier 
than normal.

Replaced milk with buttermilk because we happened to have it. They came out
fluffier and richer. I may have added a bit more than 1/2 cup. There usually is 
a slightly bitter flavor from the flour in the prior batches, but that was gone 
with buttermilk. I also added a tablespoon of buckwheat because we had it. 
Couldn't taste it.

    2/3 cup whole wheat flour
    2/3 cup Almond flour (Bob's red mill)
    1/2 tsp baking soda
    1/4 tsp sea salt
    MIX
    3 large pastured eggs, room temperature
    1/2 cup buttermilk (or whole milk if you don't have it)
    1 tbsp unsalted butter (or coconut oil), melted
    1 tbsp honey (or maple syrup)
    1 tsp pure vanilla extract
    1/4 tsp apple cider vinegar
