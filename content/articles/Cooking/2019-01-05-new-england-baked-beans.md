### Notes

put them in the instant pot for 65 minutes this time, since the 55 minutes was just shy last time. They look a little over cooked :( Here is the ingredients from the original recipe: 

1 lbs dried navy beans (2.5 cups); 1/4 lbs think bacon; 1 medium onion; 1/4 cup maple syrup; 1/3 cup molasses; 1/4 cup brown sugar (packed); 1 tablespoon worchestershire sauce; 1 table spoon ground mustard seed; 1/2 teaspoon salt; fresh ground black pepper; 1/4 teaspoon apple cider vinager

I started buying navy beans in bulk because Whole Foods stopped selling the 1lbs bag. I used 2 cups instead of 1lbs. I didn't have maple suryp, so I ignored it. Beans turned out great. Still needed to be reduced in instant pot afterwards.

I changed the recipe from 1/4 cup to 1/4 teaspoon apple cider vinegar. I think that was a typo. I also used 1/3 cup brown sugar for a double batch. Also, only did 1 onion. 

Produces 8 cups (fills 2 of our circular anchor food containers). I scooped out the bacon and onions out from the top of the watery mixture. The beans were a little under cooked at 55 min. I had to reduce the mixture for another 40 minutes on saut√© setting to thicken the sauce. This also cooked the beans perfectly. 

It was a bit too sweet. Maybe cut the brown sugar in half next time.

Cut the brown sugar in half this time, or 2/3's of the 1/4 cup filled. We cooked for 59 minutes. Making during the pandemic. It has been difficult to find navy beans.

Same as the 6/1 recipe. Still in COVID-19 world. It is now possible to find navy beans, but still much harder than it used to be.
