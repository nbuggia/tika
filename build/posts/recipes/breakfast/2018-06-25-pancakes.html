<p>I made a single batch, yielded about a dozen pancakes, probably should have done 
a double so there was enough to freeze</p>

<p>They look satisfyingly thick and fluffy. The almond flour contains a lot more 
protein and gives these more substance than other pancake recipes I've tried. </p>
<h1>October 20, 2018</h1>
<p>Added extra milk by accident (1/2 cup total vs 1/4 normal) they seemed fluffier 
than normal.</p>
<h1>Feb 17, 2019</h1>
<p>Replaced milk with buttermilk because we happened to have it. They came out
fluffier and richer. I may have added a bit more than 1/2 cup. There usually is 
a slightly bitter flavor from the flour in the prior batches, but that was gone 
with buttermilk. I also added a tablespoon of buckwheat because we had it. 
Couldn't taste it.</p>
