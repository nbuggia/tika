                    <p>Mom's favorite recipe, she likes to add scallops and broccoli (cooked ahead of 
time). It has a light and fluffy taste because there is no cheese. Double the 
recipe if making it in a standard pie plate.</p>
<ol>
<li>Roll out dough and fit to pie plate</li>
<li>Set rack in lowest position in oven and preheat to 375 degrees</li>
<li>Mix eggs in mixing bowl. When done, add cream and milk, and spices. Mix a bit
more</li>
<li>Pour filling into pie plate. Add additional pre-cooked ingredients as well, 
such as scallops, broccoli, etc. </li>
<li>Bake for 40 minutes. You will know it is done when a cake tester (or knife) 
come out cleanly from the senter. </li>
<li>Cool for 20 minutes before serving.</li>
</ol>
<p>Pro-tips: serve with a salad as a lunch/ brunch/ dinner meal. Serve with fruit 
salad for a breakfast/ brunch meal. Alternate fillings include cheese (Gruyere, 
Emmenthal, swiss, cheddar).</p>
