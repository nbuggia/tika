                    <p>Recipe came from my Mom. We used to eat these growing up. She would make a batch 
on the weekend and store the batter in the refrigerator. Then, each morning, we
would get fresh muffins baked. Cook time is 30 min when putting the batter in a 
cold oven and heating it up to 400 degrees.</p>
