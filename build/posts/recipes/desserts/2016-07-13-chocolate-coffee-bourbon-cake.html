                    <p>This cake combines the best flavors of coffee, bourbon and chocolate in a very warm and comforting way (you don’t have a problem if you find bourbon comforting, right?). Very flavorful, perfect for a Fall and Winter cake.</p>
<p>Like most cakes, this one tastes best if you give it a day or so to sit and think about what you've done before you serve it. Make sure to keep it covered to stay moist. Great if served warm, or room temperature with coffee for breakfast.</p>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<p>Pre-heat oven to 325
Coat the inside of your cake pan with butter, dust with cocoa powder
Medium Bowl – sift:
2 cups flower
1 ¼ teaspoon baking soda
½ teaspoon salt
Sauce pan – over low heat:
Melt 1 cup butter
Add 1 ½ cup coffee
Add ½ cup bourbon
Add in Cocoa a little at a time while continuing to stir
Take off the heat and stir in 2 cups white sugar
Let sit and cool for about 5 minutes
In a large mixing bowl – like your kitchenaid bowl…
Add contents from the sauce pan
Add 2 eggs
Add 1 teaspoon vanilla
Add 1 teaspoon almond extract
Mix with the paddle on a slow setting
Slowly add in contents of the medium bowl (flour, etc) while continuing to mix
Note: mixture will still be a little on the watery side at the end, that’s okay!
Pour batter into cake pan. If Bundt cake pan, maybe fill 75-80%, as it will rise. (Extra batter makes good cupcakes)
Cook about 50 minutes in middle rack (until toothpick comes out clean)</p>
<h3>Frosting Options</h3>
<p>There’s a lot of options that go well with this cake, so you’re going to have to make some difficult choices.
Ice Cream
Confectioner’s Sugar – tip, use a flour sifter to sprinkle the sugar on top of the cake.
Whipped cream – add a little bit of sugar. If you’re feeling spunky than you can fold in some molasses, or add a few things to spice it up, like coffee, bourbon, vanilla or almond extract.</p>
