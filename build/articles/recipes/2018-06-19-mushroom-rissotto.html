	<section><p>Mushroom Risotto (these risotto recipes feed 2 very comfortably) 
Arborio rice (the “risotto” rice. You can find at TJs in a red box or in most 
grocery stores, where it can be quite a bit more expensive. You’ll need about 1 
and ½ cups rice, if you are of the measuring type.)</p>
<p>Celery (2 or 3 stalks)
1 medium onion
2 garlic cloves, chopped
2 lemons 
A handful of parsley
1 cup white wine
Olive oil</p>
<p>Parmesan, pecorino or asiago cheese to finish your risotto
4 cups assorted mushrooms of your choice (dried porcini mushrooms (soak in water 
first/use water for broth), cremini mushrooms and portobello all at TJs, oyster 
mushrooms, enoki or something different from farmer's market</p>
<p>To prep the mushrooms:
Slice about 4 medium (or two large) portobello mushrooms &amp; half a package of 
cremini mushrooms, and sauté with garlic.  Set aside and repeat with any oyster 
or enoki mushrooms (their cooking time is shorter).  Combine the mushrooms when 
cooked, season with salt and a squeeze of lemon to taste.  Maybe too you'd like 
to add some fresh herbs from the garden.
(You can also consider making a porcini mushroom stock by placing about half a 
packet of (bashed) dried porcinis with 5 cups or so of water in a saucepan on 
medium heat.  When it is a lovely brown color, and smells yummy, it is done.)</p>
<p>To cook the risotto:
Practice your knife skills (yeah!) and dice the celery and onions, small.  Slow 
and steady wins the race... make nice, even cubes.  Sweat the celery and onion 
in a wide, heavy-bottomed pot with a bit of olive oil and/or butter (1-2 
tablespoons of each, but who has time to measure).  Add about 1 and 1/2 cups of 
rice (measure by sight, accuracy is not important) and stir, "toast" the rice, 
until the rice absorbs the liquid that the veggies have given off.  Add about a 
cup of wine and let rice absorb the liquid.  Generously cover the rice with 
warm water (or mushroom stock or veggie stock).  Stir, scrape the bottom to 
ensure there is no sticking.  Gently keep adding liquid as the rice absorbs 
liquid in pot, adding salt and pepper to taste.  Careful not to over stir, just 
keep the rice from sticking as it drinks!  When the rice is nearly prefect (a 
little white in middle of grain) introduce the mushrooms.  Add in parsley and 
perhaps more lemon and wine, if you like, at the last minute. Viola!  Serve 
topped with shredded or slivered cheese, if you wish.  As you enjoy this 
risotto, think about other variations that are well within your masterchef 
repertoire: for instance, adding some peas and prosciutto could be lovely, or 
even cream and sage instead of lemon and parsley.</p></section>
